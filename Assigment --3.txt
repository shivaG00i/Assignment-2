Write a program that prints all numbers from 1 to 100,  
but **replaces** multiples of 3 with `"Fizz"`, multiples of 5 with `"Buzz"`, and multiples of both 3 and 5 with `"FizzBuzz"`.

---

✨ Question 2  
Write a program that finds the **largest number** entered by the user.  
Ask the user to **enter 7 numbers**, use a **for loop**, and print the largest.

---

✨ Question 3  
Write a program to print the following pattern using **nested loops**:
```
5 5 5 5 5
4 4 4 4
3 3 3
2 2
1
```

---

✨ Question 4  
Write a program that simulates a **Guessing Game**:  
Pick a secret number, and keep asking the user to guess until they get it right.

---

✨ Question 5  
Write a program that prints all **2-digit numbers** whose sum of digits is exactly **10**.  
(Example: 19 → 1 + 9 = 10)

---

✨ Question 6  
Write a program using a **for loop** that calculates the **sum of digits** of a given number.

---

✨ Question 7  
Write a program to print all **palindrome numbers** between 100 and 200.  
(A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward.)

---

✨ Question 8  
Write a program to create a **right-angled triangle** using a character entered by the user.

Example:
```
Enter character: $
Output:
$
$$
$$$
$$$$
```

---

✨ Question 9  
Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until they enter `0`,  
then prints the **total sum** and **average** of all entered numbers.

---

✨ Question 10  
Write a program that prints all numbers between 1 and 500 that are divisible by **7** or **11**.

---

✨ Question 11  
Write a program to print this pattern (numeric pyramid):
```
    1
   1 2
  1 2 3
 1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

✨ Question 12  
Write a program to calculate the **product of odd numbers** between 1 and 15 using a **while loop**.

---

✨ Question 13  
Write a program that reverses a number using a **while loop** without using str() or reversed().

Example:  
Input: 1234  
Output: 4321

---

✨ Question 14  
Write a program to print all prime numbers from 2 to 50 using a **nested for loop**.

---

✨ Question 15  
Write a program that asks for 10 integers and  
then prints how many were **positive**, **negative**, and **zero**.
